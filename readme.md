# Data Analytics Project Description 2022
## Project description:
• Use the methods and techniques studied in lecture and lab in order to apply the Data Analytic project cycle (that you studied in lecture) on your selected datasets you like.
• The project implementation steps and requirments will go as follows:
1. Search for a real simple dataset with numeric values for the following requirements with multiple attributes (a minimum of 8 relevant attributes and minimum 50 rows).
2. Search for another real simple dataset [with texts for text mining step only] or you can create it manually as a file with minimum 20 sentences.
3. Describe the dataset attributes
4. Apply data cleaning methods (if needed)
5. Apply different data visualization charts min 2 charts [ Data Exploration], select the appropriate chart that allow you to observe more knowledge about your dataset
6. Mention your observations on your visualizations
7. Apply anomaly detection technique to find outliers
8. Apply predictive analytic techniques min 2 types
9. Apply text mining for the text dataset.

• There will be individual oral discussion
